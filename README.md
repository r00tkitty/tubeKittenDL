Cobalt doesn't download YouTube Videos anymore, so I made my own downloader :3.

## Features
- Download audio and video streams from all kinds of sites such as Twitter, YouTube, Twitch, and more!
- Completely local, so NO annoying captchas, "hot single women in your area" (ads), and rate limits!
- Uses yt-dlp for it's base, so downloads are fast and efficient!
